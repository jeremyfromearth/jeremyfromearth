## Hallo
I grew up in a small logging town near the Pacific Ocean in Oregon. Now I live in Vienna, Austria. Before becoming a Software Engineer, I operated my own recording studio in Portland and worked in record and instrument shops.

I write articles about [music, programming, software, machine learning, natural language processing and signal processing on Medium](https://medium.com/@jeremyfromearth)
