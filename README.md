## Hello
I am a Software Engineer living and working in Vienna, Austria. My main area of interest these days is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, though I have worked on quite a [variety of projects over the course of my 15 year career](https://jeremyfromearth.com/) in Software Engineering. [Sometimes I write articles about music, programming, software, machine learning, natural language processing and signal processing.](https://medium.com/@jeremyfromearth)
